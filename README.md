## Introduction  

So you have an amazing idea and want to build a startup. Great. But how do you go about it? What do you do after you have the idea? Well, here is a work-in-progress guide to help you bootstrap yourself beyond the idea phase.

## Your idea is great. But is it really?

I bet the idea you have sounds great in your head and maybe within the team as well. But ideas are like opinions, everyone has one. The way you break through this first barrier is by validating your idea. To do that you first need to:

- **Understand the problem you are solving**
  - Questions to ask yourself to help you get an answer:
    - What/Who is the problem?
    - How big is the problem? (Is it a painkiller or a vitamin?)
    - How do people currently solve the problem?
- **Understand the market/audience you are targeting**
  - Questions to ask yourself to help you get an answer:
    - Who are the people/companies that have the problem?
    - How many have the problem?
    - Are they willing to pay for a solution?
- **Understand the competition**
  - Questions to ask yourself to help you get an answer:
    - Who are the competitors?
    - What are their strengths and weaknesses?
    - What are the alternatives to your solution?
- **Have an elevator pitch that is clear**
  - Questions to ask yourself to help you get an answer:
    - Can you explain your idea to your mom? (The mom test)
    - Can you explain your idea in 1 minute?
    - Can you explain your idea in 1 sentence?
  - A/B test a pitch: create 2 different pitches and test them with different people to see which one gets a better reaction.
- **Have a clear value proposition**
  - Questions to ask yourself to help you get an answer:
    - What is the value you are providing?
    - How are you different from the competition?
    - Why should people care?

After all of these questions are resolved, you now have a better understanding of your idea and you can communicate it better. Now you can start validating your idea. The validation process is usually the first clash with reality, where you talk to real people and companies, get real feedback, and understand if your idea is really worth pursuing. This process requires the whole team to get out of their comfort zone and talk to people. It is a hard process but it is necessary. How you validate your idea is up to you, but here are some common ways:

- **Market research (desk research)**
  - Look for reports, articles, blogs, etc. that talk about the problem you are solving and the market you are targeting.
  - Look for statistics, numbers, etc. that can help you understand the size of the problem and the market.
  - Research trends, news, etc. that can help you understand the current state of the problem and the market.
  - Make a list of competitors, alternatives, etc. that can help you understand the current solutions to the problem and the market.
  - Do surveys, questionnaires, etc. to get basic feedback from people and companies.
- **Customer interviews (field research)**
  - Talk to your target companies/people to understand them and their industry.
    - Ask about their work, their day-to-day activities, and most common problems
    - Ask about the biggest problems they face, and how they are solving them right now
    - Document their problems, needs, and current solution
  - Pitch your idea to these companies/people to understand their reaction to your idea.
    - Ask about their reaction to your idea
    - Ask about the impact on their work, their day-to-day activities, etc.
    - Ask what they would like to see in your solution
  - Target the people that will USE your product NOT the people that will PAY for it.
- **Prototyping (field research + hands-on experience)**
  - Create a prototype of your idea and show it to people and companies.
    - A prototype can be anything from a simple drawing on a piece of paper, a PowerPoint mock, a miro board, or a mock website.
  - Ask for feedback and iterate on the prototype.
    - The goal is to understand if people and companies are interested in your idea and if they would use it.

### Pre-Validation Checklist

- [ ] Make a clear elevator pitch that anyone can understand
- [ ] Define the main problem you are solving
- [ ] Define potential markets/groups you can target
  - [ ] Find 3 markets/groups that can benefit from your solution
  - [ ] Find the size of the problem and the size of the market for each group
  - [ ] Pick the market/groups with the biggest problem and the most willingness to pay
- [ ] Make a competitors analysis
- [ ] Define what an MVP would look like
- [ ] Discuss the roles and commitment of each team member
- [ ] Research what roles are the people that would use your product and make a list of potential customers

## The Pitch Deck

The most common thing you will do as a founder in the idea phase is pitch your idea to people. There is no single template for the best pitch structure, but there are slides that are common to most pitches. Depending on where and who you are pitching to, you will need to adjust your pitch. The main two formats are The elevator pitch and the full pitch deck. The elevator pitch is a 1-minute pitch that you can use to explain your idea to anyone. The full pitch deck is a 10-15 slide presentation that you can use to explain your idea to investors, accelerators, etc. Here is a list of slides that are common to most full pitch decks:
